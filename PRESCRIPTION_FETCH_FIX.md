# Prescription Fetch Error Fix Summary

## Issue
- Users were getting "Failed to fetch prescriptions" error when accessing `/dashboard/prescriptions`
- Error was a 500 Internal Server Error from the `/api/prescriptions/user` endpoint

## Root Cause
The Prisma client TypeScript types were not properly synchronized with the database schema, causing compilation errors when trying to select specific fields (`medicines`, `fileUrls`, `filename`) in the prescription query.

## Solution
1. **Identified the specific fields causing issues**: `medicines`, `fileUrls`, and `filename` were not recognized by the Prisma TypeScript types despite existing in the database schema.

2. **Changed the query approach**: Instead of using a `select` object that caused TypeScript compilation errors, switched to fetching all fields with `findMany()` without select restrictions.

3. **Maintained data transformation**: Kept the existing transformation logic that safely parses JSON fields and provides backward compatibility.

4. **Improved error handling**: Enhanced frontend error handling to provide more specific error messages for better debugging.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`src/app/api/prescriptions/user/route.ts`)
- Removed problematic `select` object from Prisma query
- Used `findMany()` without field restrictions to get all prescription fields
- Maintained safe JSON parsing for `fileUrls` field
- Added proper error handling with detailed error messages

### Frontend (`src/app/dashboard/prescriptions/page.tsx`)
- Improved error handling to show specific error messages
- Added `setLoading(true)` and `setError('')` at the start of fetch
- Enhanced error message formatting

## Verification
- ✅ API authentication works correctly
- ✅ Database connection and queries work properly
- ✅ Prescription data transformation works with file URLs and medicine data
- ✅ Frontend loads without "Failed to fetch prescriptions" error
- ✅ Test prescription with file data displays correctly

## Test Data
Created test prescription for admin user:
- Medicine: Amoxicillin 500mg
- Status: approved
- File URLs: Multiple prescription file attachments
- Payment status: unpaid (ready for payment testing)

The prescription fetch functionality is now fully operational and ready for user testing.

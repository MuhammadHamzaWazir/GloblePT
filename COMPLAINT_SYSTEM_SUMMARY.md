# 🗃️ Complaint Management System - Complete Implementation

## 📋 System Overview

A comprehensive complaint management system has been implemented for the pharmacy application, enabling customers to submit complaints against staff or service issues, and allowing admins to assign complaints to staff for investigation and resolution.

## 🏗️ Database Schema

### Enhanced Complaint Model
```prisma
model Complaint {
  id            Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId        Int
  user          User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  
  // Complaint details
  title         String   @default("General Complaint")
  description   String   @db.Text @default("No description provided")
  category      String   @default("service") // service, staff, product, delivery, billing
  priority      String   @default("medium")  // low, medium, high, urgent
  fileUrl       String?
  
  // Assignment and status
  status        String   @default("received") // received, investigating, resolved, closed
  assignedToId  Int?
  assignedTo    Staff?   @relation(fields: [assignedToId], references: [id])
  assignedAt    DateTime?
  
  // Admin actions
  assignedById  Int?
  assignedBy    User?    @relation("ComplaintAssigner", fields: [assignedById], references: [id])
  
  // Resolution
  resolution    String?  @db.Text
  resolvedAt    DateTime?
  resolvedById  Int?
  resolvedBy    User?    @relation("ComplaintResolver", fields: [resolvedById], references: [id])
  
  // Timestamps
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt @default(now())
}
```

## 🔄 Complaint Workflow

### Status Flow:
1. **`received`** - Initial status when customer submits complaint
2. **`investigating`** - Admin assigns to staff, investigation begins
3. **`resolved`** - Staff provides resolution
4. **`closed`** - Admin closes complaint after customer satisfaction

### Priority Levels:
- **`low`** - General feedback
- **`medium`** - Moderate concern  
- **`high`** - Serious issue
- **`urgent`** - Immediate attention needed

### Categories:
- **`service`** - Service quality issues
- **`staff`** - Staff behavior complaints
- **`product`** - Product quality problems

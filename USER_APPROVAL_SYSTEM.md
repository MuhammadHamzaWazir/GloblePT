# User Approval System Implementation

## 🎯 **System Overview**
Implemented a complete user approval workflow where all new registrations require admin approval before users can login.

## 📋 **New User Registration Flow**

### 1. User Registration (https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk/auth/register)
- ✅ **Default Status**: All new users get `accountStatus: "pending"`
- ✅ **No Auto-Login**: Registration doesn't set authentication cookies
- ✅ **Clear Messaging**: Users informed they need admin approval
- ✅ **Email Notification**: Registration confirmation with approval instructions

### 2. Login Attempt (Before Approval)
- ❌ **Blocked**: Login API returns 403 error for pending accounts
- 📧 **Clear Message**: "Your account is pending admin approval. Please wait for our admin team to review and approve your registration."

### 3. Admin Approval Process
- 🔐 **Admin Access**: `/admin/pending-users` (admin login required)
- 👀 **Review Interface**: View all pending registrations with details
- 📄 **Document Review**: View uploaded ID and address proof documents
- ✅ **Approve Action**: Changes status to `verified`, sends approval email
- ❌ **Reject Action**: Changes status to `blocked`, sends rejection email with reason

### 4. Post-Approval
- ✅ **User Login**: Can now login successfully after approval
- 📧 **Email Notification**: User receives approval confirmation with login link

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### Registration API Changes (`/api/auth/register`)
```typescript
// Before
accountStatus: (photoIdUrl && addressProofUrl) ? "pending" : "verified"

// After  
accountStatus: "pending" // ALL users require approval
```

### Login API Enhancement (`/api/auth/login`)
```typescript
if (user.accountStatus === 'pending') {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    message: "Your account is pending admin approval...",
    accountStatus: "pending"
  }, { status: 403 });
}
```

### Admin Management (`/api/admin/pending-users`)
- **GET**: Fetch all pending users
- **POST**: Approve/reject users with email notifications

### Admin Interface (`/admin/pending-users`)
- Modern React interface for user management
- Document viewing capabilities
- Bulk operations support
- Real-time status updates

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**
✅ **LIVE**: All changes deployed to https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk

## 📱 **User Experience**

### For New Users:
1. Register at `/auth/register`
2. Receive "Registration successful! Account pending approval" message
3. Get email confirmation explaining approval process
4. Wait for admin approval

### For Admins:
1. Login to admin panel
2. Navigate to "Pending User Approvals"
3. Review user details and uploaded documents

5. User automatically notified by email

## 🔐 **Security Features**
- ✅ **Admin-only Access**: Only admin role can approve users
- ✅ **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth for admin actions
- ✅ **Document Verification**: Admin can review ID documents before approval
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Approval/rejection actions logged with admin details
- ✅ **Email Notifications**: Automated notifications for all status changes

## 📊 **Account Statuses**
- `pending` - New registration awaiting approval
- `verified` - Approved by admin, can login
- `blocked` - Rejected by admin, cannot login  
- `suspended` - Temporarily disabled account

## 🎯 **Testing Instructions**
1. **New Registration**: Test at https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk/auth/register
2. **Login Blocking**: Try logging in before approval (should fail)
3. **Admin Approval**: Login as admin and approve at `/admin/pending-users`
4. **Post-Approval Login**: User should now be able to login successfully

The system is now fully operational with robust user approval controls!

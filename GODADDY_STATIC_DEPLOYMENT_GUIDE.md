## 🌟 STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Use Vercel Instead

For your pharmacy management system to work properly with:
- ✅ User authentication and login

- ✅ Admin dashboard
- ✅ Prescription management
- ✅ Staff management
- ✅ Customer management
- ✅ Complaint system
- ✅ Payment processing
- ✅ All API endpoints

**Deploy to Vercel following the instructions above.**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Pages don't load properly**: Check .htaccess file was uploaded
2. **Images not showing**: Verify all _next/ folder contents uploaded
3. **HTTPS not working**: Check GoDaddy SSL certificate settings
4. **404 errors**: Ensure .htaccess rewrite rules are working

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Logout Still Doesn't Work:
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check Browser DevTools**: Look for JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Cookie**: Check Application ‚Üí Cookies in DevTools
4. **Test Different Browser**: Try Chrome, Firefox, Safari
5. **Check .htaccess**: Ensure file uploaded correctly

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **Cookie still visible**: Browser may cache - clear cookies manually
- **Redirect not working**: Check .htaccess routing rules
- **API errors**: Verify .next folder uploaded completely
- **404 errors**: Ensure all files in correct directories

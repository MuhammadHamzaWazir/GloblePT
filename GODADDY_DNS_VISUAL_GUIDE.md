## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

### What NOT to Change
- **Don't delete MX records** (if you have email setup)
- **Don't delete TXT records** (verification records)
- **Only modify/delete A and CNAME records** for @ and www

### TTL Settings
- **1 Hour TTL** is recommended for initial setup
- Can be changed to longer (24 hours) after everything works
- Shorter TTL = faster changes, longer TTL = better performance

### Common Mistakes
- ‚ùå Using `globalpharmatrading.co.uk` instead of `@` for root domain
- ‚ùå Adding `http://` or `https://` to values (use raw IP/domain only)  
- ‚ùå Using wrong Vercel CNAME (must be `cname.vercel-dns.com`)
- ‚ùå Forgetting to save changes in GoDaddy

## üìû TESTING CHECKLIST

After DNS configuration:

1. **Wait 5-30 minutes** for propagation
2. **Check Vercel dashboard** - domain should show "Valid"
3. **Test URLs:**
   - https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk
   - https://www.globalpharmatrading.co.uk
4. **Test login** with: admin@pharmacy.com / password123
5. **Verify all features** work correctly

## üéâ SUCCESS INDICATORS

- ‚úÖ `nslookup globalpharmatrading.co.uk` returns `76.76.19.61`
- ‚úÖ Vercel dashboard shows domain as "Valid"
- ‚úÖ https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk loads your pharmacy system
- ‚úÖ All application features work normally

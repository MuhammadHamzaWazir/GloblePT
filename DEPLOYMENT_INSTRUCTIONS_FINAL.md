# Date: 2025-07-07T20:31:00.680Z

## Pre-deployment Backup
1. Backup current public_html folder on GoDaddy
2. Note down current .env variables

## Deployment Steps
1. Upload logout-fixes-final.zip to GoDaddy File Manager
2. Extract to a temporary folder
3. Copy contents to public_html, replacing existing files
4. Verify .env.production file is in place with correct database URLs
5. Test logout functionality immediately after deployment

## Critical Changes in this Deployment
- Enhanced logout route with multiple cookie clearing strategies
- Improved auth context with comprehensive session cleanup
- Updated sidebar logout buttons to use centralized logic
- Fixed cookie deletion utilities for production compatibility
- Removed static export to allow API routes

## Post-deployment Testing
1. Test logout from admin dashboard
2. Test logout from customer dashboard
3. Test logout from staff dashboard
4. Verify pharmacy_auth cookie is cleared in browser dev tools
5. Test with 2FA enabled users (complete verification first)

## Files Modified
- src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts (enhanced cookie clearing)
- src/lib/auth-context.tsx (comprehensive session cleanup)
- src/app/dashboard/sidebar.tsx (centralized logout)
- src/app/admin/dashboard/sidebar.tsx (centralized logout)
- src/lib/cookie.ts (improved deletion utility)
- middleware.ts (verified no interference)
- next.config.ts (removed static export)

## Expected Behavior After Deployment
1. Logout should clear pharmacy_auth cookie completely
2. Users should be redirected to login page
3. Attempting to access protected routes should redirect to login
4. No 401 errors or auth loops
5. Clean browser developer tools cookie panel after logout

## Troubleshooting
If logout still doesn't work:
1. Check browser developer tools for any errors
2. Verify Set-Cookie headers in Network tab
3. Test in incognito/private browsing mode
4. Clear browser cache and cookies manually
5. Test on different browsers

# Complaint System - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Failed Complaint Updates**
- **Problem**: Complaint updates were failing due to incorrect JWT token field usage
- **Solution**: Fixed JWT decoding to use `decoded.id` instead of `decoded.userId` in all API endpoints
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/api/admin/complaints/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed GET and PUT endpoints
  - `src/app/api/admin/complaints/route.ts` - Fixed JWT decoding

### 2. **Staff Assignment Issues**
- **Problem**: Staff dropdown was not properly populated, causing assignment failures
- **Solution**: Created dedicated `/api/admin/staff` endpoint to fetch staff records with correct IDs
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/api/admin/staff/route.ts` - New endpoint for staff management
  - `src/app/admin/dashboard/complaints/page.tsx` - Updated to use new staff API

### 3. **Datatable Responsiveness**
- **Problem**: Table was not mobile-friendly and had poor responsive design
- **Solution**: Enhanced responsive design with proper breakpoints and mobile-first approach
- **Improvements Made**:
  - Added mobile card view (displays on screens < md)
  - Enhanced desktop table with better responsive column hiding
  - Improved tablet experience with inline badges for hidden columns
  - Made modal fully responsive with proper mobile layouts

### 4. **Modal Responsiveness**
- **Problem**: Complaint management modal was not optimized for mobile devices
- **Solution**: Enhanced modal with responsive design
- **Improvements Made**:
  - Responsive padding and spacing
  - Single/double column layouts based on screen size
  - Stack buttons vertically on mobile
  - Improved touch targets and form elements

# Form Submission Fix - Prevention of HTML Form Fallback

## Problem
The prescription form was showing "‚ö†Ô∏è Form submission already prevented" but still attempting to submit to the wrong URL (`https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk/dashboard/prescriptions` instead of `/api/prescriptions/user`).

## Root Cause
The React form submission handler was being called correctly, but there was a conflict between the form's `onSubmit` event and the browser's default HTML form submission behavior. The `e.defaultPrevented` check was creating a false positive scenario where the form would exit early but still trigger the HTML form action.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Button Type from `submit` to `button`
```tsx
// Before
<button type="submit" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

// After  
<button type="button" onClick={handleSubmit}>
```

### 2. Updated Form Handler
```tsx
// Before
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit} action="javascript:void(0)">

// After
<form onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()}>
```

### 3. Simplified handleSubmit Function
```tsx
// Before
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (e.defaultPrevented) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Form submission already prevented');
    return; // This was causing early exit!
  }
  // ... rest of function
}

// After
const handleSubmit = async (e?: React.FormEvent | React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
  }
  console.log('üöÄ Form submission initiated - bypassing HTML form submission');
  // ... rest of function continues normally
}
```

## Key Changes
1. **Removed HTML form submission entirely** - The form now only handles preventDefault
2. **Button click handles submission** - Direct onClick handler prevents any form conflicts
3. **Eliminated defaultPrevented check** - This was causing false positives
4. **Added stopPropagation** - Extra safety to prevent event bubbling

## Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Form submission now goes directly to JavaScript handler
- ‚úÖ No HTML form fallback to wrong URL
- ‚úÖ Proper routing to `/api/prescriptions/user`
- ‚úÖ Console shows: "üöÄ Form submission initiated - bypassing HTML form submission"

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. Form only submits via JavaScript (onClick handler)
2. No HTML form action can override the JavaScript behavior
3. Proper API endpoint is called (`/api/prescriptions/user`)
4. User sees appropriate success/error messages

This completely eliminates the form submission URL conflict that was occurring in production.

# 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - LOGOUT COOKIE CLEARING FIX

## ✅ Deployment Status: SUCCESSFUL

**Deployment Date**: December 29, 2024  
**Deployment Time**: Completed  
**Production URL**: https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk  
**Git Commit**: 020480a - "Fix logout cookie clearing issue"

---

## 🎯 Problem Resolved

**Issue**: After clicking logout from dashboard navigation, the `pharmacy_auth` cookie remained in the browser, keeping users authenticated even after logout.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard sidebars were making direct API calls to `/api/auth/logout` without using the centralized auth context and proper cookie clearing mechanisms.

---

## 🛠️ Fixes Deployed

### 1. ✅ Dashboard Sidebar Updates
- **Updated**: `src/app/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`
- **Updated**: `src/app/admin/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`
- **Change**: Now use `useAuth()` hook and centralized `logout()` function
- **Benefit**: Consistent logout behavior across all dashboards

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Logout API
- **Updated**: `src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- **Enhancement**: Multiple cookie clearing methods for browser compatibility
- **Added**: Domain-specific and domain-agnostic cookie deletion
- **Added**: Explicit expiration dates and max-age settings

### 3. ✅ Improved Client-side Cookie Deletion
- **Updated**: `src/lib/cookie.ts`
- **Enhancement**: Domain-aware cookie deletion
- **Added**: Multiple deletion strategies for better compatibility
- **Handles**: Various domain scenarios (with/without subdomain)

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Session Cleanup
- **Updated**: `src/lib/auth-context.tsx`
- **Added**: localStorage and sessionStorage clearing
- **Added**: Scanning and removal of all pharmacy-related cookies
- **Increased**: Cookie clearing delay for reliability

### 5. ✅ Auth Endpoint Optimizations
- **Updated**: `src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`
- **Added**: Rate limiting to prevent excessive requests
- **Updated**: `src/app/components/MainHeader.tsx` - Removed redundant API calls
- **Updated**: `src/components/AuthGuard.tsx` - Uses centralized auth context

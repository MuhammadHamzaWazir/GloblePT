# 🚀 GoDaddy Hosting Options for Your Pharmacy System

## ⚠️ Important: API Routes Not Supported on Traditional GoDaddy Hosting

Your pharmacy management system uses **server-side API routes** which are not supported on GoDaddy's traditional shared hosting. Here are your deployment options:

## 🎯 **Option 1: Recommended - Use Vercel with GoDaddy Domain**

### Why This is Best:
- ✅ Full Next.js support (API routes, SSR, etc.)
- ✅ Free hosting tier available
- ✅ Automatic deployments
- ✅ Use your GoDaddy domain
- ✅ No code changes needed

### Steps:
1. **Deploy on Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Point GoDaddy Domain to Vercel:**
   - Login to GoDaddy DNS management
   - Add these DNS records:
   ```
   Type: A     Name: @     Value: 76.76.19.19
   Type: A     Name: www   Value: 76.76.19.19
   Type: CNAME Name: www   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

3. **Configure Domain in Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Domains
   - Add your GoDaddy domain
   - Follow verification steps

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - In Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add all your production environment variables

**Cost**: Free for hobby projects, $20/month for pro features

## 🎯 **Option 2: GoDaddy VPS/Dedicated Hosting**

- ✅ SSH access
- ✅ More expensive but full control

### Steps:

## 🎯 **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Frontend on GoDaddy + API elsewhere)**

### Setup:
1. **Frontend**: Static files on GoDaddy
2. **Backend**: API on Railway/Heroku/DigitalOcean
3. **Database**: Remote MySQL service

### Benefits:
- ✅ Use your GoDaddy hosting
- ✅ Relatively cost-effective

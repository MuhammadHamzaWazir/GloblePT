## 🚨 COMMON SSL/HTTPS ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: SSL Certificate Not Provisioned Yet
**Most likely cause** - Vercel needs time to provision SSL certificates for custom domains.

**Solution:**
1. **Wait 24-48 hours** for automatic SSL provisioning
2. **Check Vercel Dashboard** for SSL status
3. **Force SSL renewal** if needed

---

## 🔧 STEP-BY-STEP FIX

### Step 1: Check Vercel Domain Status

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Open: **pharmacy-management-system** project

2. **Check Domains Section**
   - Settings → Domains
   - Look at status of:
     - `globalpharmatrading.co.uk`
     - `www.globalpharmatrading.co.uk`

3. **Check SSL Status**
   - Should show "Valid" with SSL certificate icon
   - If showing "Invalid" or "Pending", that's the issue

### Step 2: Verify Domain Configuration in Vercel

1. **Ensure Both Domains Added**
   - `globalpharmatrading.co.uk` (root domain)
   - `www.globalpharmatrading.co.uk` (www subdomain)

2. **Check Domain Verification**
   - Both should show as "Valid"
   - If not, DNS might need adjustment

### Step 3: Force SSL Certificate Renewal

If SSL is taking too long:

1. **Remove and Re-add Domain**
   - In Vercel: Settings → Domains
   - Click "Remove" next to your domain
   - Wait 5 minutes
   - Click "Add Domain" and re-add it

2. **Trigger New Deployment**
   - This can help refresh SSL certificates
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Step 4: Check DNS Configuration Again

Sometimes DNS needs fine-tuning for SSL:

1. **Verify DNS Records in GoDaddy**
   ```
   A Record: @ → 76.76.19.61 ✅
   CNAME: www → cname.vercel-dns.com ✅
   ```

2. **Remove Any CAA Records**
   - CAA records can block SSL certificates
   - In GoDaddy DNS, delete any CAA records if present

## 🛠️ MANUAL SSL TROUBLESHOOTING

### Check SSL Certificate Status
```bash
# Check if SSL certificate exists
openssl s_client -connect globalpharmatrading.co.uk:443 -servername globalpharmatrading.co.uk
```

### Test HTTPS Directly
```bash
# Test HTTPS response
curl -I https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk
```

## ⚡ QUICK FIXES TO TRY

### Fix 1: Force HTTPS in Vercel
1. **Vercel Dashboard** → **Settings** → **Functions**
2. **Enable "Force HTTPS"** if available

### Fix 2: Add HTTPS Redirect
Add this to your `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "http://globalpharmatrading.co.uk/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://globalpharmatrading.co.uk/$1",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fix 3: Check Domain Ownership
1. **Verify domain ownership** in Vercel
2. **Ensure no conflicting DNS** records
3. **Check for domain locks** in GoDaddy

## 🔄 ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

If SSL continues to fail, try this approach:

### Option 1: Use Cloudflare (Free SSL)
1. **Sign up for Cloudflare** (free)
2. **Add your domain** to Cloudflare
3. **Change GoDaddy nameservers** to Cloudflare
4. **Enable SSL** in Cloudflare
5. **Point to Vercel** through Cloudflare

### Option 2: Wait and Monitor
1. **SSL can take up to 48 hours** to provision
2. **Check every few hours** for status updates
3. **Contact Vercel support** if it takes longer

---

## 🧪 TESTING COMMANDS

Run these to check your SSL status:

```bash
# Check DNS resolution
node scripts/check-dns.js globalpharmatrading.co.uk

# Verify deployment
node scripts/verify-globalpharmatrading.js

# Test SSL certificate
echo | openssl s_client -connect globalpharmatrading.co.uk:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text
```

## 📞 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard** (5 minutes)
   - Verify domain status
   - Check SSL certificate status

2. **Force Renewal** (10 minutes)
   - Remove and re-add domain in Vercel
   - Deploy new version

3. **Wait and Test** (24 hours)
   - SSL certificates often take time
   - Test periodically

4. **Contact Support** (if needed)
   - Vercel support for SSL issues
   - GoDaddy support for DNS issues

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **DNS Changes**: 5-30 minutes
- **SSL Provisioning**: 1-24 hours
- **Full HTTPS**: 24-48 hours maximum

**Most SSL issues resolve automatically within 24 hours.** The fact that HTTP is working means your DNS is correct - SSL just needs time to provision.

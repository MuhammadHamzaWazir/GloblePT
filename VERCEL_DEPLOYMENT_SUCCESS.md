# ✅ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - Logout Cookie Clearing Fix

## 🎯 **ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:**

**Why was I focusing on GoDaddy public_html before using Vercel?**

You were absolutely right to question this! Here's what happened:

### 🔍 **The Confusion:**
1. **Your workspace contained legacy GoDaddy deployment scripts** - Many files referenced GoDaddy public_html deployment
2. **Mixed deployment evidence** - Both GoDaddy and Vercel configurations were present
3. **I initially followed the wrong path** - Focused on GoDaddy scripts instead of recognizing Vercel as the primary platform

### ✅ **The Reality:**
- **Vercel IS your production platform** - `globalpharmatrading.co.uk` is correctly deployed on Vercel
- **Next.js + Vercel = Perfect match** - API routes, automatic deployments, SSL, performance
- **GoDaddy scripts were legacy/backup** - Not the primary deployment method
